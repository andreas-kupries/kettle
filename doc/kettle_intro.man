Kettle is a system to make building Tcl packages quick and easy. More
importantly, possibly, to make writing the build system for Tcl
packages easy.

[para] As such kettle is several things:

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum] A DSL helping you to write build systems for your packages.
[enum] A package implementing this DSL.
[enum] An application which can serve as the interpreter for a build
       file containing commands in the above DSL.
[enum] Plus some internal supporting packages.
[list_end]

All of these will be explained in the documentation, although not
everything is for everybody. I.e. a user of the DSL requires a
different set of knowledge than a developer working on extending
kettle's DSL, etc.

[section {System Architecture}]

The image below provides a basic overview of the system's
architecture, with a package's custom build file at the top, using DSL
commands from the declaration and core layers, under the mediation of
the kettle interpreter application.
