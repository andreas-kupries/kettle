[include include/welcome.inc]

[para] This document is a guide for developers working on Kettle,
i.e. maintainers fixing bugs, extending the functionality of
application or package, etc.

[para] Users of kettle wishing to write their own high-level commands
linking into the existing foundations should read the
[term {Kettle - Core}] document instead, as that is the reference
manpage to the whole functionality available to them, and likely
enough to get going.

[para] Please read

[list_begin enum]
[enum] [term {Kettle - License}],
[enum] [term {Kettle - How To Get The Sources}], and
[enum] [term {Kettle - The Installer's Guide}]
[list_end]

first, if that was not done already.

[para] Here we assume that the sources are already available in a directory
of your choice, and that you not only know how to build and install
them, but also have all the necessary requisites to actually do
so. The guide to the sources in particular also explains which source
code management system is used, where to find it, how to set it up,
etc.

[def [file doc/]]

This directory contains the documentation sources. The texts are written
in [term doctools] format, whereas the figures are a mixture of TeX (math
formulas), and tklib's [package dia](gram) package and application.

[def [file embedded/]]

This directory contains the documentation converted to regular manpages
(nroff) and HTML.

It is called embedded because these files, while derived, are part of the
fossil repository, i.e. embedded into it. This enables fossil to access
and display these files when serving the repositories' web interface.

The "Command Reference" link at [vset kettle/core] is, for example,
accessing the generated HTML.
