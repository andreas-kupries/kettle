[subsection Tclx]

The [package Tclx] package is an optional requisite of Kettle.

If it is not installed/available to Kettle it will continue to work,
with features depending on Tclx disabled.

[para] The only feature using [package Tclx] is the colorization of
output, or rather, the code determining if Kettle should produce
colorized output by default, or not.

[para] Without [package Tclx] kettle will (on unix platforms) always
produce colorized output by default. With [package Tclx] available
kettle will use it to check if [const stdout] is connected to a proper
terminal and disable colorized output by default if not.

[para] Now that enough information is available to decide whether Tclx
should be used in your environment or not, the information on how to
get the package.

[para] Out of the many possibilites for getting Tclx (OS vendor,
os-independent vendor, building from sources) use whatever you are
comfortable with.

[para] For myself, I am most comfortable with using
[vset activestate]'s [vset activetcl] distribution and TEApot.

[para] See the previous section ([sectref Tcl]) for disclosure and
information on how to get it.

[para] Assuming that ActiveTcl got installed running the command

[example {
    teacup install Tclx
}]

will install Tclx for your platform, if you have not done the more inclusive

[example {
    teacup update
}]

to get everything and the kitchensink.

[para] For those wishing to build and install Tclx on their own, the
relevant sources can be found at

[list_begin definitions]
[def Tclx] [vset tclx]
[list_end]

together with the necessary instructions on how to build it.

[para] If there are problems with building, installing, or using Tclx
please file a bug against Tclx, or the vendor of your distribution,
and not Kettle.
