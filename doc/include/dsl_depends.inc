[call [cmd {kettle depends-on}] [arg path]...]

This command declares that the current sources depend on the packages
in the specified directories. These are best specified as relative
directories and most useful in package bundles where multiple
dependent packages are managed in a single source repository.

[para] The arguments can be paths to files too. In that case the files
are assumed to be the build declaration files of the required packages
in question. In case of a directory path kettle will search for the
build declaration file it needs.

This information is currently only used by the package-specific
"install" and "debug" recipes generated by the kettle commands
[cmd {kettle tcl}] and [cmd {kettle critcl}].
