[para] The audience of this document is anyone wishing to build the
packages, for either themselves, or others.

[para] For a developer intending to extend or modify the packages we
additionally provide

[list_begin enum]
[enum] [term {Kettle - License}].
[enum] [term {Kettle - The Developer's Guide}].
[list_end]

[para]

Please read [term {Kettle - How To Get The Sources}] first, if that was
not done already. Here we assume that the sources are already
available in a directory of your choice.

[section Requisites]

Before Kettle can be build and used a number of requisites must and/or
should be installed. These are:

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum]	The scripting language Tcl.
	This requisite is mandatory.
	For details see [sectref Tcl].

[enum]	The package [package tcltest].
	This requisite is optional.
	For details see [sectref tcltest].

[enum]	The package [package Tclx].
	This requisite is optional.
	For details see [sectref Tclx].

[enum]	The packages [package Tk], [package widget::scrolledwindow],
	[package widget::listsimple], and [package widget::dialog].
	These requisites are optional.
	For details see [sectref Tk] and [sectref Tklib].

[list_end]

This list assumes that the machine where Kettle is to be installed is
essentially clean. Of course, if parts of the dependencies listed
below are already installed the associated steps can be skipped. It is
still recommended to read their sections though, to validate that the
dependencies they talk about are indeed installed.

[include include/rq_tcl.inc]
[include include/rq_tclx.inc]
[include include/rq_tk.inc]
[include include/rq_tklib.inc]
[include include/rq_tcltest.inc]
[include include/rq_cmdr.inc]

[section {Build & Installation}]

To install Kettle simply run

[example {
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/kettle/build.tcl install
}]

where [file /path/to/tclsh8.5] is the tclsh of your Tcl installation, and
[file /path/to/kettle] the location of the Kettle sources on your system.

[para]

This will build the package and application and then places them into
directories where the [cmd tclsh8.5] will find them. Note that the
installed kettle application is modified to use the chosen tclsh
instead of searching for one on the [var PATH].

[para]

On Windows you can invoke the file [file build.tcl] with a
double-click.  This will pop up a small graphical interface for
entering the destination and performing the installation. This
handling of a double-click is restricted to Windows only however.

[para]

On unix the same GUI is acessible by invoking [file build.tcl] using
[const gui] instead of [const install] in the example above.

[para]

To get help about the methods of [file build.tcl], and their complete
syntax, invoke [file build.tcl] with argument [method help], i.e., like

[example {
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/kettle/build.tcl help
}]

Other methods for gfetting various types of help are:

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum] help-recipes
[enum] help-options
[enum] help
[enum] list-recipes
[enum] list-options
[enum] list
[enum] show-configuration
[list_end]
