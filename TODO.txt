(1)	Switch over to cmdr 1 for the cli API.

	- Heavy rewrite of internals, notably option definition and
	  use to get away from shared options.

(1a)	Store a copy of cmdr framework in the project, to break
	installation cycle.

	Without: Kettle install requires Cmdr requires Kettle.

(2)	Better integration of the project mgmt features/commands.
	No special cli code anymore.


(4)	Command(s) to scan a directory and classify the files in it,
	for setting up the build.tcl file:

	- Tcl packages
	- Critcl packages
	- Documentation
	- Testsuites
	- Benchmarks
	- Tcl applications
	- Files to Ignore

	This classification should detect variety of files in the
	above classes even when not marked properly, i.e. missing the
	proper magic strings.

(5)	An outgrowth of (4), validation of the project, i.e. checking
	it against various rules (must have docs, tests, should have
	benchmarks) and other external tools, like tclchecker,
	nagelfar, frink, etc.

(6)	Command history

(7)	Always generate the testsuite X.* files, store results in the
	project, as files ignored by default.

	New commands to query this database.

(8)	Ditto for benchmarks.

(9)	Helper commands to generate testsuite and benchmark skeletons
	from templates.
